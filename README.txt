CS584 Data Mining Project 2: Gradient Descent Function


In order to run the code on Jupyter Notebook, please make sure the below packages are installed:
numpy
pandas
nltk
re
sklearn


* When calculating the weights of the features using 1 million iterations before scaling, change the range for plotting the convergence graph to exit_point.

* When calculating the weights of the features using 10e-3, 10e-4 learning rates after scaling, change the range for plotting the convergence graph to exit_point_scaling.


Result files:
* results_10k.csv - test data classification when gradient descent was performed using 10k iterations.
* results_100k.csv - test data classification when gradient descent was performed using 100k iterations.
* results_1M.csv - test data classification when gradient descent was performed using 1 Million iterations.
